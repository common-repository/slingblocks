== Why did we build SlingBlocks? ==

Truth be told we never intended to build a block plugin.

We at [FunnelKit](https://funnelkit.com/?utm_source=WordPress&utm_medium=SlingBlocks&utm_campaign=WP+Repo) were looking for a plugin that would seamlessly allow our Funnel Builder to provide templates for Gutenberg.

When we began looking at various Block Plugins none of them could match to fit our needs.

WooFunnels had previously integrated with Elementor, Divi and Oxygen and we wanted nothing short of the experience.

**SlingBlocks was born.**

Combine SlingBlocks with our Funnel Builder and you get a powerful sales funnel building suite using Gutenberg.

Our hope is that it's not only a companion plugin for WooFunnels but also for your next project.



== Looking for templates? ==

**SlingBlocks does not include templates.**

Get access to templates for Sales Pages, Optin Pages, Checkout and Thank you pages all built with SlingBlocks with Funnel Builder by WooFunnels.

Funnel Builder allows you to create lead generation and sales funnel flows.

Download [Funnel Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/funnel-builder/) and get access to more blocks.

* **Optin Block**: To create optin and squeeze pages to capture leads

* **Checkout Block**: To create beautiful WooCommerce one-page checkout or global checkout for your store

* **Thank You Page Block**: To present a nice looking thank you page

* **One Click Upsell Blocks (Pro)**: To present one-click upsell offers to increase average order value


== Installation ==

There are two ways to install SlingBlocks.

1. Go to "Plugins > Add New" in your Dashboard and search for: SlingBlocks
2. Download the .zip from WordPress.org, and upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.
